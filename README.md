# Traffic Light Optimazation system
This repository contains project about optimazation traffic lights with reinforcement learning used in my bachelors thesis

## Idea

Whole project will be about one crossroad with 4 traffic lights and 2 lines per each road.<br/>
So, our model makes 4 decisions for which side to select for the green signal<br/>
we have to select minimum time (ex. 10s) that our model can not select green light.

Task is to minimize the amount of time that vahicles have to wait on the traffic signal.<br/>
